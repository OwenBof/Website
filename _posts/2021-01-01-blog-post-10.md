TODAY,, I know, I know, despite saying I would not revise. Here I am. On the first of january. Revising. Nono. its ok. Because at least I might smash my gcses. But ,,,,, , , ,, REVISION!!1! BUT BEFORE THE REVISION! I woke up and went into TOWN (thinking the shops would be open like a OI OI) and tried to get a McDonalds (yh no). N3xt i went on a bike ride somewhere in a place with trees in a forest 0-0!! After this i got home and like. Revised, for like. Hours. I kno. I don’t know why i did that either. Until 9pm. Then I joined a voice chat AGAIN with my bestfriend (jENNY) and JOE. Hopefully we will play minecraft and then i will sleep but only after we’ve won. Nothing exciting happened on new years day that’s rlly sad oh no :9 but. HAPPY JANUARY 1ST EVERYONE. G00DN0IGHT.
