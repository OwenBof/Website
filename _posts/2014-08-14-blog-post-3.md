TODAY I woke up late. I opened stockings. I got bike tyres. They came in a fancy bag. Then I had a fun shower. Then I opened presents under the tree. I got a bunch of cool presents that I am very grateful for, such as clothes and money. Then I opened my tyres and struggled to put them on my bike. My thumbs went numb, (oh no) it was sad. Eventually after sweat and tears I got the tyres on my bike and I went for a quick ride. They were very nice. Unfortunately, the tyres got muddy and I will have to wash them when I get back to my house (el casa de los boffeys). IUASDHUIOAHDOADH.
