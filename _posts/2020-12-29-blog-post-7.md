TODAY I went on a bike ride with Joshua! It was MEGA fun! I brought my GO PROand videoed us doing some siCK skiLlS! I then went to MCDONALDS and ate A DOBLE BIGR MAC MEAL (heart eyes) (YUM!) WHENI got h0me,,,I uploaded the go-pro clips to youtube (private ofc - link needed!) and thanks to Tom’s “dislike josh’s vid and like owen’s vid”, Josh’s got 102 views and 46 dislikes (party emoji: 🎉) and I am famous. Next I WAS ON VOICE CHAT and I had an am4zing conversation with everyone there. Sadly no juegé minecraft today because i spent loads of time revising and let me tell you - I know what stem cells are!!!!!!!!! N Ex T, Laura showed me an amazing painting that she hadn’t quite finished (“but don’t write that as it’s not that funny!”) (I assure you it is decently funny). After this, I thought that it would be productive to try and put this website into a dark theme, let’s just say you’re currently reading this on a LIGHT THEME website,,,
