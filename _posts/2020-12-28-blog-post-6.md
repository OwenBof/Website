TODAY this day started, like any other, with some lovely revision! After this, I was able to join a call with my best friends Joe and Jenny 
(Jenny’s my bestest friend btw! - you guys sure? Yes very)! We played some Minecraft during which I had to leave 8 MINUTES INTO A GAME, but 
because Joe and Jenny are just such legends, they continued the game for another 35 minutes and won the game after the two people on the yellow 
team were thrown off bridges by dragons! (yay). After this, I re-designed owenboffey.com with the help of Joe (it looks peng now). Jenny would 
have helped but she was busy lying on her front garden for some reason (HEY! She was showing off her lighty reindeers which we enjoyed a lot).
It was very fun to watch Jenny set up a TV and I was lucky enough to receive some chocolate coins from Laura. I then ate those chocolate coins.
Every single one of them (hEaLtH). Good for the heart. I then decided that I was going to do some random stuff and like talk for a while!!!!!!!!
After that, I left the voice chat and went to bed and was very happy becoz I don’t have to get up for paper-round tomorrow - actually, I might 
get up and go on a bike ride through some mud and the coldness because I’m insane :)) ANYWAY. G00dnight! (dreading washing my bike, I’m 
complaining because washing my bike is pointless! It should come like pre-wrapped in anti-mud stuff). Goodnight :)
