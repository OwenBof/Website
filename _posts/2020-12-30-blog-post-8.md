TODAY I started this lovely day with some lovely revision📘📚 (jus jokin it wosnt loveleh but I am capable of doing revision so I did it so I get good GCSE - u know if they even happen)! I went over some science and looked at my Spanish again (NEEK). I completed three CorbettMaths tasks because I’m a mathematics professiona (1+1=window!!!!!) (call me a comedian) After this, I ORDERED a new 🚴🏿‍♂️DROPPER POST for my pro mountain bike!!!!!!!!!! This is gonna make me a professional cyclist and I am so hyped to try it when I am able to leave my house (boing boing) because SOMEONE decided to take a trip to the party tent 🎉🎉🎉) (PARTY TENT) and take a test for COVID-19 (the rona). I was very excited to play some minecraft with my best friends Joe and Jenny (joe is 100% the bestest though! Are u like genuinely sure tho Jenny is a pretty great friend and a SICK 🤮bedwars player :0) and we had some pro hypixel gaming fun (u know, winning bedwars and all such💅💅. It was rather hilarious to join lobby 52 where everyone on the 🔥SERIAL FLAME🔥 VC was hanging out, I don’t think they lyke us vry moch porque we were annoying🤣😱. :DDDDDDDm Goodnight!
