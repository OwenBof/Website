TODAY I woke up and didnâ€™t go the restaurant today twas so sad. (awwww). It was depressing to realise that it is no longer Lauraâ€™s birthday, however itâ€™s christmas eve today!!!!! I really like christmas eve because it means tomorrow is christmas, who wouldâ€™ve guessed. N e way, what did i do today? Glad u asked! I actually canâ€™t remember. I know that i was probably being summoned by Joe and Jenny because my g0d theyâ€™re needy and Iâ€™m just SO popular that i need to be present at all times. (u do (party emoji: ðŸŽ‰)) (especially at 11:30) i really liked staying up until 11:30 with them because i enjoy theyâ€™re company and tea cam is where itâ€™s at :D (ngl it is)(it really is!!!). I think that Joe makes the best tea because Jenny doesnâ€™t use the correct mug (top daddy!) (JOEâ€™S WAS JUST SALTY AND I KNOW THIS - imagine putting salt in tea ðŸ¤¢ JBASFBAKJ) (shush I dONâ€™T PUT SALT IN MY TEA) (smh heâ€™s lying me and JOE know just how much of a weirdo this JENNY GIRLis) Ok what now????
