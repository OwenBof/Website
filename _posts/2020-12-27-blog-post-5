TODAY is a very special day, it marks the first day which this blog will be hosted on owenboffey.com! First and foremost,,, I woke up and had to do paper round (boo). I earned a hefty £4.50 before returning home to join discord and see the legendary joe collyer and jenny payling. At first, I was extremely sad because Jennyp was not on discord and I had to wait until ONE PM until she got on, that was very sad and I missed her presence dearly!!!! Joe on the other hand was not missed. Becoz he woz there duh/. N E WAY!!1!??!?!?!1?!? After this, I wanted to play some minecraft with my friends but then realised that revision is MUCH more fun!. I ended up joining hypixel and playing bedwars with wumflord, moggiedoggie and the other one who was there (can’t remember was it twitchnotDELUXE_?) moving on! Issariya111 sacrificed her spot for me to play and then I left half way through the game (I know I’m such a meanie!!!! FOOD FTW THO so sorry not sorry but sorry) I spent the rest of the afternoon bedwaring, death running, block partying and fountaining!!!!! (we love the fountain!) 0-0 yiss we do!!! I had to listen to a bunch of raging 15 yr olds scream over losing death run and that hurt my ears, I also learnt I have a new scream where I sound like a low-pitched tommyinnit! (jk u don’t idk why u sayd that) Next, I spent time writing this blog (not my friends! me!) and then we went back to playing minecraft because Jenny insisted!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GOODBYE… OH YEAH I FORGOT THAT I REVISED TODAY. I feel accomplished! Well done me!! It made me feel just like so ecstatic (big w0rds!) when the amazing Joe and Jenny crowdfunded to pay for this amazing domain name (I did pay for over half of it OK - they split the extra 18p that I provided.) (a 9p refund for both Jenny and Joe!) Ok, fr, GOODBYE NOW.
