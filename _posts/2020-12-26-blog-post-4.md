TODAY i was super hyped for the SerialFlame virtual boxing day event.I spent most of my day talking to a bunch of random canadian people and playing grinch simulator, which, if i must say, i am GREAT at. After this, I had either a turkey or chicken curry for my afternoon snack, which I found delicious. Alright so, I was then bugged by the irritating Jenny to play more bedwars, I said yes because bedwars is the best game ever (better than grinch simulator!) (did i lie). MOVING ON. At this point, my best friend (<- he wishes) Joe got up and we played some hypixel, I was very excited to see him because Jenny had started getting annoying. Jenny won bedwars and carried the team as usual with her insane pvp skills and Joe, I guess, helped with his diamond bridging. I suck though, I bridge dumb. I had lots of fun talking to everybody on SerialLFlame, and haven’t done any revision all day! (YAY) I feel very guilty about not revising though.... :))))))))))))))))))))))) no I don’t. Lmao yes i do.
