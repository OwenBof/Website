TODAY I woke up and did something. I got up and made great use of my time by doing some revision!!!! today I thought that it would be great to get some science done (n33k) (jokes I'M actually kinda smart) but after I did what I did I CLEANED MY BIKE. Like. Squeaky clean!!🤩🚴🏿‍♂️🚴🏿‍♂️🚴🏿‍♂️(ZOOOOOM) (nyeeom nyeooom). I even cleaned the little bits. Like the 🔗⛓ch41N⛓🔗 that fell apart on my lawn🤣 where I LOS T a LITTLE CIRcLE THING so now my chain is shorter. That⛓ means the chain🔗⛓🔗 doesn’t fit on my bike⛓🔗🔗⛓!!!!!!!! This is a🔗⛓⛓ TRAGEDY because I won’t😭😭 be able to ride it until I FIND🙀🍎 the missing piece!!! 🚲🚲🚳🚳🚳. (NOOOOOOOOOOO) OH WELL🔇 at least I can upgrade to a sparkly golden shineeeyeyy3yy new chain👁👅👁. After this,,, (oh yeh I probably revised because I said I revise Spanish like twice a day for sum reason but yeah at least I'm great at Spanish) (booyah) I played MINECRAFT where I was a god at bedwars with wumflord, mickey mouse and joodah. AFTERWARDS I PlayED more Minecraft but this time it was with Jenny and some other people (I think the one of the other people was called like,,, John? June? Joan?)
